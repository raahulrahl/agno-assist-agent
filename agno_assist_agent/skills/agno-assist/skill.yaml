# Description
description: |
  Intelligent documentation assistant for the Agno framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  Provides accurate, documentation-grounded responses by searching indexed documentation using
  hybrid semantic and keyword search. Maintains conversation context and minimizes hallucinations
  through source-grounded generation.

# Rich Documentation
documentation:
  overview: |
    This skill provides intelligent documentation assistance for the Agno framework
    using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It indexes official documentation,
    performs hybrid semantic and keyword search, retrieves relevant content, and
    generates grounded responses using OpenRouter LLM.

    The agent maintains conversation context using Mem0 and optionally stores
    documentation embeddings in LanceDB for persistent vector search.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Getting answers about Agno framework features"
      - "Learning how to implement specific Agno components"
      - "Finding documentation-based code examples"
      - "Understanding Agno architecture and best practices"
      - "Getting help with configuration and deployment"
      - "Exploring knowledge base and tool integrations"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Questions unrelated to the Agno framework"
      - "General coding help outside documentation scope"
      - "Creative writing tasks"
      - "Image generation or media tasks"
      - "Financial or medical advice"

  input_structure: |
    Accepts natural language queries about the Agno framework.

    Example (Plain Text):
    "How do I create an agent with tools?"

    Example (JSON):
    {
      "query": "How does hybrid search work in Agno?",
      "include_examples": true
    }

    Constraints:
    - Maximum 1000 characters per query
    - English language supported
    - Timeout: 120 seconds for retrieval and generation
    - Must relate to Agno framework documentation

  output_format: |
    Returns structured documentation-based responses.

    Output Structure:
    - SUCCESS: Boolean indicating retrieval success
    - ANSWER: Documentation-grounded explanation
    - SOURCES: List of documentation sections with relevance scores
    - CODE EXAMPLES: Extracted examples when available
    - METADATA:
      - Original query
      - Processing time
      - Vector database usage flag
      - Memory context usage flag

  error_handling:
    - "No documentation match: Suggest broader or rephrased query"
    - "Vector database unavailable: Fall back to non-vector retrieval"
    - "API failure: Return graceful degradation message"
    - "Timeout: Return partial response with explanation"
    - "Documentation not indexed: Trigger indexing process"

  examples:
    - title: "Basic Agent Creation"
      input:
        query: "How do I create a basic agent in Agno?"
      output:
        success: true
        sources_found: 3
        processing_time_ms: 7200

    - title: "Knowledge Base Setup"
      input:
        query: "How do I implement a knowledge base with LanceDB?"
      output:
        success: true
        code_examples_returned: 1
        processing_time_ms: 8500

  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Ensure documentation is indexed before production use"
      - "Cache frequent queries to reduce processing time"
      - "Monitor vector database size and cleanup periodically"
      - "Provide clear source attribution in responses"
      - "Use structured JSON input for complex queries"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route Agno framework documentation queries to this skill"
      - "Fallback to general assistant for non-Agno questions"
      - "Limit concurrent requests to 3 for optimal performance"
      - "Monitor OpenRouter and Mem0 API usage"
      - "Chain with general coding assistant if broader help needed"
