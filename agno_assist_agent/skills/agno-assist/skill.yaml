It provides the tools necessary for building multi-agent systems that integrate memory, knowledge, and various tools. Here’s how you can get started with Agno:\n\n### Steps to Get Started with Agno\n\n1. **Installation**:\n   - First, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this using pip:\n     ```bash\n     uv pip install -U agno openai tantivy psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n   - Make sure to set your API keys. For example, for OpenAI:\n     ```bash\n     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n     ```\n\n2. **Create Your First Agent**:\n   - Start by creating a simple agent using Python. Below is a basic example:\n     ```python\n     from agno.agent import Agent\n     from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses\n\n     agent = Agent(model=OpenAIResponses(id=\"gpt-5.2\"))\n\n     agent.print_response(\"Hello, what can you do?\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure the Database**:\n   - Setup a database to store sessions, run history, and more. You can use SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.\n     ```python\n     db_url = \"sqlite:///agno.db\" # For SQLite\n     ```\n\n4. **Explore Toolkits**:\n   - Agno includes a variety of toolkits that enhance agent capabilities. You can integrate tools like Daytona for running code, ReasoningTools for complex problem-solving, and many others.\n\n5. **Develop and Test Your Agent**:\n   - Utilize the provided SDK to build and test your agent in various scenarios. Implement custom tools and workflows as needed.\n\n6. **Deploy to Production**:\n   - Use AgentOS to deploy your agents as production-grade APIs, ensuring they interact smoothly and scale effectively.\n\n### Exploring Agent Features\n\n- **Memory & Sessions**: Store user interactions to maintain context across conversations.\n- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Implement hybrid search with vector databases like PgVector or Pinecone.\n- **Workflow Integration**: Create complex workflows using WorkflowTools for structured operations.\n- **Tool Integration**: Use various tools like Notion, HackerNews, or DuckDuckGo to extend agent capabilities.\n\nThis basic guide will help you set up and begin using Agno for your AI-driven projects.
